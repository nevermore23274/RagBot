# RAG Bot
A few basic RAG books.

If you want to run the containers individually then see the [container document](https://github.com/nevermore23274/RagBot/blob/main/ContainerCommands.md), otherwise you should only need:

```
sudo docker-compose up --build
```

This will build both containers, which will be located at either `localhost:8888` or `localhost:8501` in a browser.
